# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The SOW Navigator exists to solve the persistent problem of complex Statement of Work (SOW) documents being difficult to understand, navigate, and maintain context with. Traditional document viewers provide little to no assistance in understanding relationships between requirements, deliverables, timelines, and responsibilities.

## Problems Solved
1. **Information Overload**: SOW documents often contain hundreds of pages with complex relationships that are difficult to track manually.
2. **Requirement Relationships**: Stakeholders struggle to understand how different sections of an SOW relate to each other and impact project execution.
3. **Context Loss**: Users frequently lose context when navigating between different sections of large SOW documents.
4. **Collaboration Challenges**: Team members often have different understandings of SOW requirements due to the difficulty in maintaining consistent interpretation.

## How It Should Work
1. **Document Upload**: Users should be able to upload PDF or DOCX SOW documents through an intuitive interface.
2. **Interactive Visualization**: The application should display SOW requirements and relationships in an interactive graph format.
3. **Contextual Navigation**: Users should be able to click on any requirement to see related sections, dependencies, and impacts.
4. **Memory Bank Integration**: The application should remember user preferences, recent documents, and analysis settings between sessions.
5. **Accessibility**: The interface should be usable by all stakeholders, including those with disabilities, following WCAG 2.1 standards.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Onboarding**: New users should be able to understand the core functionality within 2 minutes of first use.
2. **Efficient Navigation**: Users should be able to find any SOW section and its related requirements in 3 clicks or less.
3. **Visual Clarity**: The interface should present complex information in a clear, digestible format without overwhelming users.
4. **Consistent Experience**: The application should maintain a consistent look, feel, and interaction pattern across all features.
5. **Performance**: The application should respond to user interactions within 100ms and maintain smooth 60FPS animations.
