# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The SOW Navigator follows a component-based architecture with the following layers:
1. **Presentation Layer**: React components for UI rendering and user interaction
2. **Document Processing Layer**: Services for document parsing and data extraction
3. **State Management Layer**: Context API for managing application state and memory bank
4. **Persistence Layer**: Local storage and file system for maintaining state across sessions

## Implementation Patterns
1. **Component Structure**:
   - Base components for common UI elements
   - Feature components for specific functionality (document upload, visualization)
   - Container components for stateful logic and data handling

2. **Document Parsing**:
   - Service-oriented approach with separate parsers for PDF and DOCX
   - Abstracted parsing interface for extensibility
   - Performance-optimized parsing algorithms to meet 30-second requirement

3. **Interactive Visualization**:
   - Graph-based representation of SOW relationships
   - Framer Motion for smooth transitions and animations
   - Contextual highlighting of related requirements
   - Clickable nodes for requirement exploration

4. **Memory Bank**:
   - Hierarchical documentation structure
   - Interdependent files that build upon each other
   - Markdown format for easy editing and version control
   - Git version control for tracking changes and evolution

5. **Accessibility**:
   - Semantic HTML structure
   - ARIA attributes for interactive elements
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - High contrast color scheme options

## System Evolution
1. Initial setup: Memory bank system for persistent context
2. Document parsing architecture planning
3. Visualization component design
4. Accessibility feature implementation strategy
5. Performance optimization approaches
