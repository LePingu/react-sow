# Progress

## What Works
- Memory bank directory has been created and organized
- Initial memory bank files have been established with project-specific content:
  - projectbrief.md: Project name, mission, objectives, and constraints
  - productContext.md: Detailed user needs and experience goals
  - systemPatterns.md: Architecture overview and implementation patterns
  - techContext.md: Technology stack and development setup details
  - activeContext.md: Current work focus, recent changes, and next steps

## What's Left to Build
- Implement document upload and parsing functionality
- Develop interactive visualization of SOW relationships
- Integrate memory bank persistence across sessions
- Implement accessibility features and performance optimizations
- Update memory bank files to reflect the current state of the project

## Current Status
- Memory bank system is in active development phase
- Project-specific documentation has been established
- Memory bank files have been updated to reflect the current state of the project
- Next steps involve implementing core application functionality

## Known Issues
- Document parsing functionality has not been implemented yet
- Interactive visualization components are still in design phase
- Memory bank persistence needs to be integrated with application state
- Memory bank files need to be updated to reflect the current state of the project

## Evolution of Project Decisions
1. Decision to create a memory bank system to address knowledge loss between sessions
2. Decision to use a hierarchical, interdependent file structure for documentation
3. Decision to focus on project-specific details in the memory bank
4. Decision to prioritize document parsing performance and accessibility
5. Decision to use React + TypeScript + Vite for the 'sow-navigator' project based on requirements
6. Decision to update memory bank files to reflect the current state of the project
