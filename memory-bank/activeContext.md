# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- Enhancing the memory bank with project-specific details
- Implementing document upload and parsing functionality
- Developing the interactive visualization component
- Ensuring accessibility and performance requirements are met
- Updating memory bank files to reflect the current state of the project

## Recent Changes
- Updated projectbrief.md with specific project goals and constraints
- Enhanced productContext.md with detailed user needs and experience goals
- Completed initial memory bank structure
- Implemented basic component structure for document visualization
- Updated activeContext.md and progress.md to reflect the current state of the project

## Next Steps
1. Implement PDF and DOCX parsing functionality
2. Develop the interactive graph visualization for SOW relationships
3. Integrate memory bank persistence across sessions
4. Implement accessibility features and performance optimizations

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritizing document parsing performance to meet the 30-second requirement
- Using Framer Motion for animations to ensure smooth 60FPS transitions
- Implementing WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards throughout the UI
- Structuring the codebase for maintainability as complexity grows

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Separation of concerns between document parsing and visualization
- Performance-focused implementation of interactive features
- Accessibility-first approach to UI design
