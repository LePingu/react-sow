# Technical Context

## Technologies Used
1. **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used for creating the 'sow-navigator' application.
2. **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, used for adding static types to the project.
3. **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server, used for bundling and serving the application.
4. **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code, used for linting the project.
5. **Less**: A CSS pre-processor used for styling the application.
6. **Framer Motion**: A library for animations in React, used for adding animations to the application.

## Development Setup
1. **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript code.
2. **npm**: The package manager for Node.js, used for managing project dependencies.
3. **TypeScript Compiler**: Used for compiling TypeScript code to JavaScript.
4. **Vite**: Used as the build tool and development server.
5. **ESLint**: Used for linting the project code.
6. **Less Compiler**: Used for compiling Less files to CSS.

## Technical Constraints
1. **Browser Compatibility**: The application must be compatible with modern web browsers.
2. **Performance**: The application should be optimized for performance, with fast load times and smooth interactions.
3. **Accessibility**: The application should be accessible to users with disabilities, following accessibility best practices.
4. **Security**: The application should be secure, with proper handling of user data and protection against common web vulnerabilities.

## Dependencies

5. **ESLint**: Version 9.25.0
6. **Less**: Version 4.3.0
7. **Framer Motion**: Version 12.12.2

## Tool Usage Patterns
1. **Development**: The project is developed using Vite as the build tool and development server.
2. **Linting**: ESLint is used for linting the project code, with custom rules configured in the ESLint configuration file.
3. **Styling**: Less is used for styling the application, with modular and reusable styles.
4. **Animations**: Framer Motion is used for adding animations to the application, with smooth and performant animations.
